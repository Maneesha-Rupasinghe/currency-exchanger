 Additional Information

   Due to the limitations of API calls, I have cached the file on GitHub. If you want to make direct API calls, uncomment line 17 in the src\components\currencyConvertor.tsx file and comment out line 18 (GitHub link).

   To clear the cache, uncomment lines 19 to 24 in the same file mentioned above.
